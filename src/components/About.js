        I’m Vanshita Pamnani, a front-end developer passionate about building
        visually engaging and performance-driven web applications. With a
        background in nutrition and design, I bring a unique mix of analytical
        problem-solving and creative storytelling to my development process. I
        focus on writing clean, efficient code and crafting interfaces that not
        only look great but also offer seamless user experiences. Currently, I’m
        exploring modern frameworks like React and working on projects that help
        me grow as both a developer and a designer.
